## <b>Introduction</b>
I created this app with FLASK-RESTful API to visually present the work I did on the Credit Card customers kaggle dataset. The problem is trivial - you need to build a model that can correctly classify whether the user is satisfied with banking services, and therefore whether he will remain a client in the future. Since we have highly structured (tabular) data, an effective solution was to use a model based on decision trees. LGBM - fast efficient boosting tree-based model, that has shown itself to be excellent among other candidates.
As soon as this is a full-cycled ML project with a deployment, the best option to familiarize yourself with the project is to visit its [website](http://olehator.pythonanywhere.com/). Good trip.
